  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the underlying application programming interface (API) of the Cisco Jabber Guest Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system information from the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific values passed via HTTP GET or POST methods by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sniffing the data traffic on the network. If successful, the attacker could access sensitive system information from the system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need to access internal networks to sniff data in the network. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
