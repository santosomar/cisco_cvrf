  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in RSVP processing of Cisco IOS XR could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the RSVP process on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of a malformed RSVP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed RSVP packet to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the RSVP process on the affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send numerous TCP sessions to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
