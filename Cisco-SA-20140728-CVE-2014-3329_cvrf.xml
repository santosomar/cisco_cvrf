  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web server hosting the Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface.



The issue is due to insufficient input validation of parameters by the web server. An attacker could exploit this issue by convincing a user to access a malicious link.

Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
