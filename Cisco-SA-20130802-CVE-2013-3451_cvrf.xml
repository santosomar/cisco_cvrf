  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web pages of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. An exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the Cisco Unified CM via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link to a malicious site and persuade the user to follow the link by using misleading language and instructions.</Note>
