  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed authentication messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication packet with invalid variables. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial availability condition due to the invalid packet reaching the Connection Manager of the VCS.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to send a crafted authentication packet with invalid variables to a targeted device, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
