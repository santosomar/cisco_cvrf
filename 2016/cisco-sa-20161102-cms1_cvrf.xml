    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) parser of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.



The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of the size of media lines in session descriptions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the SDP parser on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on an affected system, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms1["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms1"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Affected Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">Cisco Meeting Server incorporates video, audio, and content-sharing capabilities into software that can be accessed via a conference room, desktop, or mobile device. Cisco Meeting Server works across Cisco video rooms and connects with Skype for Business and other hardware providers to allow a seamless meeting architecture. This capability exists via collaboration between Cisco and Acano, who joined Cisco in early 2016.</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="3">This vulnerability affects the following products:


    Cisco Meeting Server releases prior to Release 2.0.3
    Acano Server releases 1.9.x prior to Release 1.9.5
    Acano Server releases 1.8.x prior to Release 1.8.17

For more information about this vulnerability in Acano Server releases 1.8.x and 1.9.x, see the following resources on the Acano website: Acano Server &amp; VM Release 1.8.17 Release Notes["ftp://ftp.acano.com/software/server/1.8/1.8.17/Release%20Notes%20R1.8.17.pdf"] and Acano Server &amp; VM Release 1.9.5 Release Notes["https://www.acano.com/publications/2016/09/Release-Notes-R1.9.5.pdf"]



To determine whether a system is affected by this vulnerability, administrators can check the system configuration by using the Cisco Meeting Server command-line interface (CLI). To determine which release of Cisco Meeting Server is running on a system, administrators can issue the version command in the CLI and refer to the output of the command.




The following example shows the output of the version command for a system that is running Cisco Meeting Server Release 2.0.6:

system&gt; version

2_0_6

    <Note Title="Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable" Type="General" Ordinal="4">No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="5">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="6">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]



Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.



When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.



In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.




Customers Without Service Contracts




Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]



Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.




Fixed Releases




This vulnerability has been fixed in the following releases:


    Cisco Meeting Server Release 2.0.3
    Acano Server Release 1.9.5 
    Acano Server Release 1.8.17 

Customers are advised to download the latest Cisco Meeting Server release from the Software Center["http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products &gt; Conferencing &gt; Video Conferencing &gt; Multiparty Conferencing &gt; Meeting Server &gt; Meeting Server 1000 &gt; TelePresence Software.



Customers can download Acano Server Release 1.9.5 and Acano Server Release 1.8.17 from the FTP library["ftp://ftp.acano.com/software/server"] on the Acano website.</Note>
