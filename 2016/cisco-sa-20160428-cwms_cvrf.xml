    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server (CWMS) web interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an undesired web page.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters in the HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. This vulnerability is known as an "Open Redirect Attack" and is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without their knowledge.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
