  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Mobile Device Management (MDM) portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a parameter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are unavailable.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
