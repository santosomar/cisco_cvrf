  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) interface of the Nexus 3000 (N3K) Series Switch could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of
service (DoS) condition to the SNMP service running on the device.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an SNMP request with a non-existent Object Identifier (OID). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to the
affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial DoS condition of the SNMP interface where SNMP requests with legitimately formatted OIDs will time out. The DoS condition does clear and SNMP requests will start to be processed normally as expected.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
