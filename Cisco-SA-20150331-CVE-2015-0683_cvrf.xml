  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to unspecified condition within the affected software that could allow local file inclusion.  An attacker who could successfully authenticate to a targeted system could exploit this vulnerability to view sensitive content on a targeted system. A successful exploit could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
