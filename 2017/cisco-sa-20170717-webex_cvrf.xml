  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows.

The vulnerability is due to a design defect in the extension. An attacker who can convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page or follow an attacker-supplied link with an affected browser could exploit the vulnerability. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser.

Cisco has released software updates for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:
https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170717-webex ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170717-webex"]</Note>
    <Note Title="Vulnerable Products" Type="General" Ordinal="2">This vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx extensions for Windows when running on most supported browsers. The affected browsers are Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

    <Note Title="Workarounds" Type="General" Ordinal="4">There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, Windows users may use Internet Explorer and administrators and users of Windows 10 systems may use Microsoft Edge to join and participate in WebEx sessions because Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are not affected by this vulnerability. Additionally, administrators and users can remove all WebEx software from a Windows system by using the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available from https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-2672 ["https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-2672"].</Note>
    <Note Title="Fixed Software" Type="General" Ordinal="5">Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html"]

Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

Customers Without Service Contracts

Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html ["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html"]

Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

  Browser Updates
The following subsections provide instructions for updating the Cisco WebEx browser extensions. Customers can allow their browsers to auto-update by launching the browser and keeping the browser window open for 3-6 hours, during which time the extensions will be auto-updated.

Note: Should the browser window close before the auto-update check completes, the timer will reset, requiring a browser window to be launched at a later time and remain open for 3-6 hours to receive the update.

Google Chrome

The Cisco WebEx extension for Google Chrome version 1.0.12 was released on July 13, 2017, and contains a fix for this vulnerability. Chrome users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the Cisco WebEx extension for Google Chrome by doing the following:

In Chrome, click the menu button (three dots at the upper right of the application) and choose More Tools &gt; Extensions.
Check the Developer mode check box at the top of the extensions manager. Chrome will display a row of buttons.
Click the Update extensions now button.

Restart the Chrome browser.
Mozilla Firefox

The Cisco WebEx extension for Mozilla Firefox version 1.0.12 was released on July 12, 2017, and contains a fix for this vulnerability. Firefox users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the Cisco WebEx extension for Mozilla Firefox by doing the following:

In Firefox, click the menu button (three horizontal bars at the upper right of the application) and choose Add-ons
Click the Extensions tab
Locate Cisco WebEx Extension in the list of extensions and click the More link to obtain the version information
Click the cogwheel next to the search bar and choose Check for Updates
Microsoft Internet Explorer

Because there are shared components between the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions and Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer users will be prompted to update Cisco WebEx plug-ins. The plug-ins are available as part of the Cisco WebEx client packages associated with each WebEx product, and will be available to download after a WebEx site has been upgraded to a fixed version. Upgraded clients are available from the Downloads section of each site after an upgrade has been performed. Users that connect to an upgraded site without the updated client software may be prompted to perform an online upgrade.

Customers may check that the browser plug-in upgrade was successful by using the following procedures for Microsoft Internet Explorer:

Note: The registered name of the plug-in in Internet Explorer may differ based on the installation method used for the plug-in. The version of the plug-in depends on the version of Cisco WebEx that provided the update. The update may have been applied either via the web when joining a WebEx meeting or by a local update of the client via an MSI file. When a fixed version of the plug-in from any version of Cisco WebEx is installed, it will not be downgraded or changed to a version installed by a different fixed version of Cisco WebEx. Internet Explorer users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the plug-in for Internet Explorer by doing the following:

In Internet Explorer, click the Tools button (the cog icon at the upper right of the application) and choose Manage add-ons.
From the Show drop-down menu, choose All add-ons.
Select either the Download Manager or GpcContainer Class add-on under Cisco WebEx LLC. The version number is displayed at the bottom of the Manage add-ons window.

Validate that the Download Manager version or GpcContainer Class version displayed is one of the version strings in the following table:
                              Cisco WebEx Major Version              Fixed GPC Container or Download Manager Version                                   32.3.4.5               10032.3.2017.711                                   31.14.3.30               10031.14.2017.711                                   31.11.11               10031.11.2017.0713                                   30.20.3.10012               10030.100.2017.0711                                   30.9.3               10030.100.2017.0713                                   30.6.7               10030.100.2017.0713
