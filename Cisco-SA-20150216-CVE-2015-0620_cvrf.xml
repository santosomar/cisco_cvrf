  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the configuration of the XML parser of the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition. 



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML external entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting POST requests to the targeted system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. These requirements would likely decrease the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
