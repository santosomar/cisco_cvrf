  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute unwanted actions.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking the user of a web application into executing an adverse action.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
