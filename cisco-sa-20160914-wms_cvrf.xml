  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user accounts by specific services. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly attempting to access a specific service, causing the system to perform computationally intensive tasks and resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
