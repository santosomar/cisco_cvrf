  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ based authentication services offered by the affected application.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input processed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a special sequence of characters when prompted for a targeted user's password. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to any system that uses TACACS+  and relies on the authentication service provided by the affected software in the networking environment.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability and software updates are available.




A successful exploit requires an attacker to know a valid username stored in the LDAP external identity store. If valid usernames have been compromised, the attacker can impersonate only those users. Administrators may consider using role-based access controls (RBAC) for users in the environment to help protect network resources in the event of a successful exploit. In addition, an attacker would likely need access to an internal, trusted network in which a targeted device may reside, decreasing the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCuc65634</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) contains a vulnerability that could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the TACACS+ based authentication
service offered by the affected product.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the user-supplied password when TACACS+ is as authentication protocol and Cisco
Secure ACS is configured with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) external identity store.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a special sequence
of
characters when prompted for the user password. The attacker would need to know a valid username stored in the LDAP external
identity store in order to exploit this
vulnerability, and the exploitation is limited to impersonate only that user. An exploit could allow the attacker to successfully authenticate
to any system using TACACS+ in combination with an affected Cisco Secure
ACS.



Note: Only a Cisco Secure ACS that is configured for TACACS+ authentication and uses LDAP as the external identity store is vulnerable.

A Cisco Secure ACS used for authentication service in combination with other supported protocols, such as RADIUS, or TACACS+ used in combination with an internal identity store or other external stores (for example, RADIUS Identity Server, Active Directory,
and RSA SecurID Token Server),


is not vulnerable. 



Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the  attacker to bypass the
authentication of any system that uses TACACS+ and relies on the authentication service provided by an
affected Cisco Secure ACS. However, the attacker will not be able to gain unauthorized access to the management interface of the Cisco Secure ACS.

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators may consider disabling anonymous binding on the LDAP external identity store or use a different Active Directory to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability if these options are possible in the production environment.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
