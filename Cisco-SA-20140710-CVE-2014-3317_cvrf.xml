  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Multiple Analyzer of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Dialed Number Analyzer (DNA) could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to delete files from arbitrary locations on the filesystem.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted URL
requests to a vulnerable device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to an affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
