  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the file upload dialog of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload potentially malicious files.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering and validation of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading an unintended file type to the ISE. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload a potentially malicious file that could be used to compromise another system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
