  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the phone proxy feature of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to temporarily insert an invalid entry in the phone proxy connection database.



The vulnerability is due to the acceptance of an untrusted certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted certificate to the phone proxy process. An exploit could allow the attacker to insert an invalid entry into the phone proxy connection database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks to submit a crafted certificate to the phone proxy process on an affected device. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
