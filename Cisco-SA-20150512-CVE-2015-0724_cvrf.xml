  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based administration interface of the Cisco Headend Digital Broadband Delivery System could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain parameters passed via HTTP GET or POST methods to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.</Note>
