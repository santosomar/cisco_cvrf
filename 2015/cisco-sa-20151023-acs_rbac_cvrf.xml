    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation of the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of the system by modifying dashboard portlets that should be restricted.

 

The vulnerability is due to improper RBAC validation when a new administrative dashboard or portlet is created. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a non-privileged user and navigating to what should be a restricted web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create a dashboard or portlet, which should not be allowed.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
