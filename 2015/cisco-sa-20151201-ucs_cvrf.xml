  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the HTTP web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Central Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a user-supplied value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected system via a web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
