  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to map a file system structure.



The vulnerability is due to different handling of existent and nonexistent paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enumerating all possible URIs and gathering the answers that the server gives to those paths. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the file system structure and which URIs are valid resources.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
