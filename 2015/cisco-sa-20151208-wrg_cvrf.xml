  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco EPC3928 Wireless Residential Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied value and a lack of encoding of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click on a malicious link.
