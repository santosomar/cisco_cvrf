  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted commands to the affected parameter in the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to read, write, and overwrite any file on the system or execute arbitrary code.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to an affected device. These requirements may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
