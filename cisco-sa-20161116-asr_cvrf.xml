  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IPsec component of StarOS for Cisco ASR 5000 Series routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to terminate all active IPsec VPN tunnels and prevent new tunnels from establishing, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE messages toward the router. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the ipsecmgr service. A reload of the ipsecmgr service might result in all IPsec VPN tunnels being terminated and new tunnels being unable to establish until the service has restarted, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
