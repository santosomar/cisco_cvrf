    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the initial setup script of Cisco Unified
Computing System fabric interconnect (FI) devices could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the
underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to
unfiltered input in the cluster initial configuration script. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering invalid parameters
during initial setup. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the daemon user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



This issue can be exploited only during the initial setup and configuration of a clustered Unified Computing System fabric interconnect device. An attacker would need to be on the same private subnet that the device uses for configuration during the short configuration period in which the device performs its initial configuration.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
