  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the image upgrade facility of Cisco Collaboration Desk
Experience (DX) Series endpoints could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to execute commands in the context of the underlying
operating system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient
sanitization of input during the image upgrade process. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by inserting shell commands into a
parameter using common techniques.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted system. These requirements would likely reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
