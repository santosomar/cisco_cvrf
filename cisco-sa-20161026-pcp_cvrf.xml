  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web framework code of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface of the affected system. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by intercepting the user request and injecting malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
